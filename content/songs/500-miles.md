When I wake up, Well, I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you  
When I go out, Yeah, I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you  

If I get drunk, Well, I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you  
And if I haver, Yeah, I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you  

But I would walk five hundred miles  
And I would walk five hundred more  
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles  
To fall down at your door

When I'm working Yes, I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you  
And when the money Comes in for the work I do  
I'll pass almost every penny on to you  

When I come home, Oh, I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you  
And if I grow old, Well, I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you  

But I would walk five hundred miles  
And I would walk five hundred more  
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles  
To fall down at your door

Da-da, da-da (Da-da, da-da)  
Da-da, da-da (Da-da, da-da)  
Da-da-da, lie, da-da-lie, da-da-lie, da-da-lie, da-da  
Da-da, da-da (Da-da, da-da)  
Da-da, da-da (Da-da, da-da)  
Da-da-da, lie, da-da-lie, da-da-lie, da-da-lie, da-da

When I'm lonely, Well, I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you  
And when I'm dreaming, Well, I know I'm gonna dream  
I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you  

When I go out, Well, I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you  
And when I come home, Yes, I know I'm gonna be  
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home with you  

But I would walk five hundred miles  
And I would walk five hundred more 
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles  
To fall down at your door

Da-da, da-da (Da-da, da-da)  
Da-da, da-da (Da-da, da-da)  
Da-da-da, lie, da-da-lie, da-da-lie, da-da-lie, da-da  
Da-da, da-da (Da-da, da-da)  
Da-da, da-da (Da-da, da-da)  
Da-da-da, lie, da-da-lie, da-da-lie, da-da-lie, da-da

But I would walk five hundred miles  
And I would walk five hundred more 
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles  
To fall down at your door
